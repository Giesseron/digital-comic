# Image Mapping Guide

## Your 23 Images → Story Structure

### Linear Introduction (Images 1-7)
- **1.png** → Scene 1: Opening scene
- **2.png** → Scene 2
- **3.png** → Scene 3
- **4.png** → Scene 4
- **5.png** → Scene 5
- **6.png** → Scene 6
- **7.png** → Scene 7: FIRST DECISION POINT

### After First Decision (Images 8-12)
Both struggle and acceptance paths show the same images but with different emotional context:

- **8.png** → Scene 8 (both struggle and acceptance paths)
- **9.png** → Scene 9 (both paths)
- **10.png** → Scene 10 (both paths)
- **11.png** → Scene 11 (both paths)
- **12.png** → Scene 12 (both paths)

### Second Decision Point (Image 13)
- **13.png** → Scene 13: SECOND DECISION POINT (with parallel visualization enabled)

### Parallel Paths with Visualization (Images 14-17)
After the second decision, both paths are shown simultaneously:
- Main path: Full size, normal brightness
- Alternative path: Small and dark (40% opacity)

- **14.png** → Scene 14 (both paths shown together)
- **15.png** → Scene 15 (both paths shown together)
- **16.png** → Scene 16 (both paths shown together)
- **17.png** → Scene 17 (both paths shown together)

### Two Absolute Endings

#### If Struggle Path Chosen at Second Decision:
- **18.png** → STRUGGLE ENDING (Scene 18)
  - Emotional state: Sadness, disconnection, no enjoyment
  - Same place as acceptance ending, different emotional experience
  - **Absolute ending - no return, no restart**

#### If Acceptance Path Chosen at Second Decision:
- **19.png** → Scene 19 (acceptance main, struggle shown small/dark)
- **20.png** → Scene 20 (acceptance main, struggle shown small/dark)
- **21.png** → Scene 21 (acceptance main, struggle shown small/dark)
- **22.png** → Scene 22 (acceptance main, struggle shown small/dark)
- **23.png** → ACCEPTANCE ENDING (Scene 23)
  - Emotional state: Presence, connection, enjoyment
  - Same place as struggle ending, different emotional experience
  - **Absolute ending - no return, no restart**

✓ After second decision, parallel visualization shows alternative path (small + dark)
✓ Two absolute endings representing same place, different emotional states
✓ No restart or replay after endings
✓ Story structure preserved exactly as designed
